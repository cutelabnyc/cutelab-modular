CuteLab is an electronic instrument manufacturer and community space located in Gowanus, Brooklyn. It was founded to provide free/donation based workshops to the public on digital art making, programming, and hardware design. During quarantine, we have found a new passion for making hardware and software musical instruments.

We build our instruments to explore engineering as a creative process. Through this practice we try to make interfaces that we would use in our own musical work. We're interested in hearing new sounds, and in designing tools that approach making music in a new way.

Our hobbies include homotopy type theory, political organizing, and playing Splatoon 2.

We couldn't do what we do without our dear friends at [Boran](http://boranrestaurant.com/), [Lowlands](http://lowlandsbar.com/).
